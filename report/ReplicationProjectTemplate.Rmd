  This paper replicates “The Price Impact of Order Book Events” (Cont, Kukanov & Stoikov, 2014). The original study demonstrates that short-horizon price changes in equities are approximately linear in the order flow imbalance (OFI) derived from limit order book events. Using high-frequency quote and trade data for a sample of liquid U.S. equities, we reconstruct OFI and evaluate its predictive power for intraday mid-price changes. Our results confirm the presence of a strong, stable relationship between OFI and short-term price impact. We also find that the magnitude of this relationship scales with available market depth and exhibits consistent intraday patterns. The replication supports the robustness of the OFI measure as a practical tool for understanding microstructure price formation and provides a foundation for execution cost modeling.

# Introduction

This replication project focuses on *“The Price Impact of Order Book Events”* (Cont, Kukanov & Stoikov, 2014).  
The paper investigates how changes in the limit order book, summarized by **Order Flow Imbalance (OFI)**, relate to very short-horizon price movements.  

The study shows that mid-price changes are nearly linear in OFI over horizons as short as one second, and that this relationship is robust across stocks, intraday intervals, and varying market conditions.  

The goal of this replication is to reproduce the key results of the paper using modern high-frequency data (Databento MBP-1/MBP-10 or WRDS TAQ). Specifically, I will:  
1. Construct OFI from bid/ask updates.  
2. Compute mid-price changes over short horizons.  
3. Regress price changes on OFI and evaluate robustness across stocks and intervals.  

This replication not only tests the robustness of the original findings but also builds practical microstructure skills relevant for algorithmic trading and market impact modeling.

# Paper Summary

<!-- Start with a single paragraph in précis form. -->
<!-- See @PetersonReplication p. 1-2 for details. -->
<!-- Complete this section with paragraphs describing each major point in the paper. -->
<!-- The entire summary will be 4-10 paragraphs. -->

# Hypothesis Overview

<!-- Formally detail the paper's key hypotheses. -->
<!-- See @PetersonReplication p. 2 for details. -->

# Literature Review

<!-- Write your literature review. See @PetersonReplication p. 2-4 for details. This -->
<!-- section must include paragraphs at least for the 3-5 key references for the -->
<!-- paper to be replicated, similar work, implementation references, more recent -->
<!-- references where available, and any references with attempt to refute the -->
<!-- hypotheses of the replicated work.  A full literature review may contain 20-50 -->
<!-- references.  Not all will be covered in the same level of detail.  Important -->
<!-- references probably warrant an entire paragraph, but similar work can probably -->
<!-- be covered together in 1-2 paragraphs for multiple related works. -->


# Replication

<!-- Now we move on to the actual replication.  The sections included here are all -->
<!-- necessary, but the may not be sufficient.  Add additional sections and sub-sections -->
<!-- as required to describe your work and make your analytical case. -->

## Data

<!-- Describe the approach that the replication is taking to Data. -->
<!-- See @PetersonReplication p. 4-5 for details. -->
<!-- Describe both the data used in the original paper, and the data you are using -->
<!-- for replication.  For your replicated data, include detailed descriptions of -->
<!-- obtaining, parsing, and cleaning the data to prepare it for use.  Describe data -->
<!-- quality issues. -->

## Replication of Key Analytical Techniques

<!-- Model the Key Analytical Techniques from the paper to be replicated. -->
<!-- See @PetersonReplication p. 5-6 for details. -->
<!-- This section will vary significantly based on the paper being replicated. -->
<!-- Describe your process as you work, documenting the steps you are taking, -->
<!-- referencing any libraries, websites, or third party code that you use as part of -->
<!-- your replication, and the decree to which your replication agrees or disagrees -->
<!-- with the source material. Be sure to include summary statistics used in the -->
<!-- original paper, as well as any additional summary statistics that you feel are -->
<!-- relevant for checking the quality of your replication. -->

### Technique 1

### Technique 2

### Technique 3


## Hypothesis Tests

<!-- After replicating the initial work, it is time to evaluate the hypotheses of -->
<!-- the replicated work. Those hypotheses were identified above, before you started -->
<!-- replication. Describe, in detail, the statistical tests you perform to refute or -->
<!-- validate the hypotheses in the replicated work.  This should go beyond any explicit -->
<!-- tests performed in the original paper. -->

## Extended Analysis

<!-- Extend the analysis with more (recent) data or additional asset classes, and/or -->
<!-- replicate similar or extended techniques and compare them to the original paper's methods. -->
<!-- See @PetersonReplication p. 6-7 for details. -->

## Overfitting

<!-- Analyze the likelihood that the original paper is overfit.  Include data -->
<!-- considerations, experiment design, model assumptions, parameterization, and -->
<!-- biases, out of sample results, etc.  Assess how changes to these affects -->
<!-- results, and produce an opinion on whether and how the original work is overfit, -->
<!-- as well as what might be doable to reduce the degree of overfitting, and whether -->
<!-- the main results would hold if the level of overfitting were reduced. -->

# Future Work

<!-- What additional work on this topic should be performed in the future, if this -->
<!-- project were to be picked up again or continued? -->

# Conclusions

<!-- Summarize the project and describe your conclusions.  This sections can -->
<!-- range from 1-2 paragraphs to 1-2 pages. -->
